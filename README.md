## To Do List :
 - make the bullets look realistic
 - do things when they collide walls
 - texture walls (texture which are my own)
 - Do the 3D as shader (not sure if that's possible)

 - ### Ideas : 
    - nuumbers on hit
    - score
    - objects/ power-up (different caractters)
    - real map / story mode

 - ### To fix :

    - stutter/lag when too many entities (multi - client)
    - walls disappearing when shooting (multi - client)
