## To Do List :

 - fix the jittering of the walls (duplicated walls I can't seem to be able to detect)
 - make the bullets look realistic
 - do things when they collide walls
 - texture walls (I mean put real textures cause right now they're ugly)
 - Do the 3D as shader (not sure if that's possible)
